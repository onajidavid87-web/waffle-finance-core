# Gas Regression Test Harness - Implementation Guide

## Overview

A comprehensive gas regression testing harness has been implemented in [`contracts/test/gas-regression.test.ts`](contracts/test/gas-regression.test.ts) to monitor contract gas usage over time and prevent silent regressions.

## What Was Created

### Test File: `contracts/test/gas-regression.test.ts`

The harness includes:

1. **Gas Thresholds** - Baseline limits for all critical operations
2. **Measurement Helpers** - Functions to capture and validate gas usage
3. **Test Suites** - Comprehensive coverage of all HTLC operations
4. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end swap sequence analysis
5. **Summary Reports** - Pretty-printed baseline documentation

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.5+
- npm or pnpm 9+
- Hardhat dependencies

### Installation Steps

```bash
# From root directory
cd waffle-finance-core

# For npm workspaces:
npm install

# OR for pnpm (if installed):
pnpm install

# Navigate to contracts
cd contracts
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

If you encounter `ERESOLVE` errors with npm:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps --force
```

## Running the Tests

### Execute All Gas Regression Tests

```bash
# From contracts directory
npm test -- --grep "Gas Regression"
```

### Run Specific Test Suites

```bash
# HTLCEscrow operations only
npm test -- --grep "HTLCEscrow Gas Benchmarks"

# ResolverRegistry operations only
npm test -- --grep "ResolverRegistry Gas Benchmarks"

# Full integration test
npm test -- --grep "Full Cross-Chain Swap"

# View gas summary
npm test -- --grep "Gas Summary Report"
```

### Run All Contract Tests (includes gas regression)

```bash
npm test
```

## Test Coverage

### HTLCEscrow Operations

| Operation             | Tests | Purpose                                       |
| --------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `createOrder(native)` | 1     | Native ETH order creation with safety deposit |
| `createOrder(ERC20)`  | 1     | ERC20 token order with approval               |
| `claimOrder`          | 2     | Claim with preimage reveal (native + ERC20)   |
| `refundOrder`         | 2     | Refund after timelock expiry (native + ERC20) |
| `withdraw`            | 1     | Withdraw from pull-payment balance            |

### ResolverRegistry Operations

| Operation       | Tests | Purpose                                     |
| --------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `register`      | 1     | Register as resolver with stake             |
| `increaseStake` | 1     | Increase existing stake amount              |
| `unregister`    | 1     | Unregister and withdraw stake               |
| `slash`         | 2     | Slash resolver (normal + excessive amounts) |

### Integration Tests

| Test               | Purpose                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Full Swap Sequence | Measure total gas for create + claim operations |

## Gas Thresholds

The baseline thresholds (with 10% variance buffer) are:

```typescript
createOrderNative:  120,000 gas
createOrderERC20:   165,000 gas
claimOrder:         105,000 gas
refundOrder:         95,000 gas
withdraw:            40,000 gas

register:           115,000 gas
increaseStake:       75,000 gas
unregister:         110,000 gas
slash:               85,000 gas
```

**Note:** Thresholds allow ±10% variance to accommodate minor fluctuations from:

- Network state variations
- Block timestamp differences
- Minor compiler optimizations

## Interpreting Test Output

### Successful Run

```
Gas Regression Suite
  HTLCEscrow Gas Benchmarks
    createOrder
      ✓ createOrder with native ETH should not regress (234ms)
      ├─ createOrder(native): 87234 gas (limit: 132000)
```

### Regression Detection

```
  1) claimOrder should not regress
     ├─ claimOrder: 125800 gas (limit: 115500)
     └─ ⚠️  GAS REGRESSION: claimOrder used 125800 gas,
        exceeding limit of 115500 (threshold: 105000)
     Error: claimOrder gas usage (125800) exceeds threshold (105000) + 10% variance
```

When a regression is detected:

1. Test fails with clear error message
2. Actual gas vs. threshold is displayed
3. Variance buffer is shown
4. Developer must investigate the contract change

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Example

Add to your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Run Gas Regression Tests
  run: |
    cd contracts
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    npm test -- --grep "Gas Regression"
```

### Continuous Monitoring

The gas regression tests should run on:

- ✅ Every PR (gate merge)
- ✅ Pre-deployment (catch before mainnet)
- ✅ Post-deployment (establish new baseline if intentional)

## Updating Thresholds

When contract changes intentionally increase gas:

1. **Verify the change is intentional** - Review contract modifications
2. **Understand the impact** - Calculate user cost increase
3. **Update thresholds** - Edit `GAS_THRESHOLDS` in test file
4. **Document the change** - Commit message should explain why

Example threshold update:

```typescript
const GAS_THRESHOLDS = {
  claimOrder: 125_000n, // Increased from 105k due to new security check
  // ... other thresholds
};
```

## Debugging High Gas Usage

If tests fail with gas regressions:

### 1. Confirm It's Real

```bash
npm test -- --grep "claimOrder should not regress"
```

Run multiple times - if consistent, it's real.

### 2. Generate Gas Report

```bash
REPORT_GAS=true npm test
```

This generates `gas-report.txt` with detailed per-function breakdown.

### 3. Compare to Baseline

- Check git history for when threshold was set
- Review any recent contract changes
- Look for added loops, storage writes, or external calls

### 4. Investigate Contract Changes

```bash
# Find what changed
git log --oneline -n 20 contracts/contracts/

# View specific changes
git diff HEAD~5 contracts/contracts/HTLCEscrow.sol
```

## Test Architecture

### Helper Functions

**`measureGas(tx)`**

- Takes a transaction response
- Returns gas used (BigInt)
- Handles receipt and error cases

**`assertGasBelow(actual, threshold, name)`**

- Validates gas usage against threshold + 10% buffer
- Logs detailed output
- Throws if exceeded

**`deployEscrow()`, `deployToken()`, `deployResolverRegistry()`**

- Fresh contract instances for each test
- Isolates state between tests
- Configurable parameters for edge cases

### Isolation

Each test:

- Gets fresh contract instances
- Independent timelock values
- Isolated signer accounts
- Clean blockchain state (Hardhat networks reset between tests)

## Performance Impact

- **Test runtime:** ~15-25 seconds for full suite
- **CI overhead:** Minimal (<5% of total test time)
- **Deterministic:** Same result every run (Hardhat test network)

## Known Limitations

1. **Hardhat Network Only** - Tests run on simulated network
   - Real network gas may vary slightly
   - Use as early warning, not absolute guarantee

2. **Compiler Optimizer** - Gas depends on Solidity version
   - Update thresholds when upgrading compiler
   - Document changes in commit

3. **Storage State** - Initial state affects gas
   - Tests start with empty contracts
   - Real usage patterns may differ

## Maintenance Checklist

- [ ] Run tests before any contract merge
- [ ] Update thresholds if intentional gas increases
- [ ] Document threshold changes
- [ ] Monitor gas trend over releases
- [ ] Review expensive operations quarterly

## Example: Adding New Operation

To add gas tracking for a new contract function:

```typescript
describe('newOperation', () => {
  it('should not regress', async () => {
    const [caller] = await ethers.getSigners();
    const contract = await deployEscrow();

    // Setup
    // ...

    // Execute
    const tx = await contract.connect(caller).newOperation(params);

    // Measure
    const gas = await measureGas(tx);
    assertGasBelow(gas, GAS_THRESHOLDS.newOperation, 'newOperation');
  });
});
```

Then add threshold:

```typescript
const GAS_THRESHOLDS = {
  // ...existing...
  newOperation: 50_000n, // Estimated from test run
};
```

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tests timeout

**Solution:** Increase timeout in hardhat.config.ts

```typescript
mocha: {
  timeout: 40000; // ms
}
```

### Issue: Gas values unstable

**Solution:** This is normal variance. Increase buffer or check for:

- Non-deterministic code (timestamps, randomness)
- External RPC calls affecting state
- Insufficient test isolation

### Issue: Threshold too tight

**Solution:** 10% buffer should be sufficient. If hitting edge:

1. Run multiple times to confirm variance
2. Increase buffer by small amount (e.g., 115% vs 110%)
3. Document in git commit
